Exercise 1.4:Observe that our model of evaluation allowsfor combinations whose operators are compound expres-sions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of thefollowing procedure:

(define(a-plus-abs-bab)
  ((if(>b0) + -)ab))

The procedure checks if b is superior to 0. in which case it sums a and b. If it is not it substracts b to a.

the first part of the procedure consists of a logical argument to see which operator is used in the operation of a and b.
